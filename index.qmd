# Introduction

The three-point revolution in the NBA represents one of modern sports' most dramatic transformations, yet it remains largely unexplored quantitatively. We chose this topic to answer a simple question: *How has basketball fundamentally changed?* For unfamiliar readers, the NBA is the world's premier professional basketball league where, historically, games centered on post players (the tallest/biggest people on the court) and half-court offense. Today, they center on perimeter shooting and pace. The three-point line was introduced in 1979 but was largerly not utilized until it became mathematically superior to mid-range shooting. Our central questions are: When did teams collectively adopt this strategy? Did all positions transform equally? And did the revolution actually make basketball better? Through statistical analysis of 46 years of NBA data (1979-2025), we provide quantifiable evidence of how basketball's most fundamental strategic shift unfolded.
