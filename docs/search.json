    "text": "3.1 The Three-Point Shot\nWe begin our analysis by examining the evolution of the three-point shot. Since the NBA started tracking threes in 1979, the league has undergone a dramatic transformation in both volume and efficiency. By exploring how three-point attempts and accuracy have changed over time, we can better understand the shifting strategies and playstyles that define the modern game.\nCode\nggplot(data = league_avgs, aes(x = start_year, y = x3pa_num)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"steelblue\", size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(color = \"steelblue\", size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"3-Point Attempts Over Time\",\n    subtitle = \"Average 3-point attempts per game by season (1979-2025)\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"3-Point Attempts per Game\",\n    caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 40, 5)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1979, 2025, 5)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray40\"),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, color = \"gray50\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray90\")\n  )\nCode\nleague_avgs &lt;- league_avgs |&gt;\n  mutate(x3p_num = as.numeric(x3p),\n         x3p_pct = (x3p_num / x3pa_num) * 100)\n\nggplot(data = league_avgs, aes(x = start_year, y = x3p_pct)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"coral\", size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(color = \"coral\", size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"3-Point Shooting Efficiency\",\n    subtitle = \"Average 3-point percentage by season (1979-2025)\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"3-Point Percentage (%)\",\n    caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(25, 40, 2.5)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1979, 2025, 5)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray40\"),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, color = \"gray50\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray90\")\n  )\nFrom this graph, we can clearly see a steady rise in three-point attempts over time. A closer look reveals a distinct period in which the three-point shot surged in both usage and importance, signaling a major shift in how the game was played. Let’s identify this pivotal era and explore the factors that sparked its transformation.\nCode\nleague_avgs &lt;- league_avgs |&gt;\n  arrange(start_year)\n\nfive_year_changes &lt;- league_avgs |&gt;\n  mutate(x3pa_5yr_ago = lag(x3pa_num, 5),\n         five_year_change = x3pa_num - x3pa_5yr_ago,\n         five_year_pct_change = (five_year_change / x3pa_5yr_ago) * 100,\n         period = paste(start_year - 5, \"-\", start_year)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(five_year_change)) |&gt;\n  select(start_year, period, x3pa_num, x3pa_5yr_ago, five_year_change, five_year_pct_change)\n\nbiggest_increase &lt;- five_year_changes |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(five_year_change)) |&gt;\n  slice(1) |&gt;\n  select(-start_year)\n\nprint(biggest_increase)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n  period      x3pa_num x3pa_5yr_ago five_year_change five_year_pct_change\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2014 - 2019     34.1         22.4             11.7                 52.2\nFrom this table, the most significant surge occurs between 2014 and 2019. This period stands out as a transformative era for the three-point shot. To understand what drove this rapid rise, we’ll take a closer look at the top three-point shooters from these years and explore to understand what happened.\nCode\nggplot(yearly_stats_long, aes(x = factor(Year), y = Value, fill = Metric)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.7, alpha = 0.85) +\n  facet_wrap(~Metric, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 1, strip.position = \"top\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"3-Point Attempts\" = \"steelblue\", \n                                \"3-Point Efficiency (%)\" = \"coral\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Evolution of 3-Point Shooting Among Elite Shooters\",\n    subtitle = \"Average statistics of top 5 three-point leaders per season (2007-2019)\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = NULL,\n    caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray40\"),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, color = \"gray50\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"gray95\", color = NA),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\nFrom this graph, we see that three-point attempts among elite shooters steadily increased over time, which aligns with the trend observed earlier. What is particularly striking is that their efficiency remained consistently high despite the rising volume. This suggests that top shooters became even more skilled by expanding their shot volume without sacrificing accuracy. This development is crucial in elevating the value of the three-point shot, as players were now able to score efficiently at much higher frequencies. Next, we will look at the winningest teams from this era to evaluate their playstyle and determine whether they embraced the three-point shot.\nCode\nseason_2014 &lt;- season_2014 |&gt; left_join(win_loss_2014, by = \"team\")\nseason_2015 &lt;- season_2015 |&gt; left_join(win_loss_2015, by = \"team\")\nseason_2016 &lt;- season_2016 |&gt; left_join(win_loss_2016, by = \"team\")\nseason_2017 &lt;- season_2017 |&gt; left_join(win_loss_2017, by = \"team\")\nseason_2018 &lt;- season_2018 |&gt; left_join(win_loss_2018, by = \"team\")\n\ntop10_list &lt;- list(\n  \"2014-15\" = season_2014,\n  \"2015-16\" = season_2015,\n  \"2016-17\" = season_2016,\n  \"2017-18\" = season_2017,\n  \"2018-19\" = season_2018\n)\n\ntop10_list &lt;- lapply(top10_list, function(df) {\n  df |&gt;\n    mutate(\n      W = as.numeric(W),\n      x3pa = as.numeric(x3pa),\n      x3p_percent = as.numeric(x3p_percent)\n    ) |&gt;\n    arrange(desc(W)) |&gt;\n    slice(1:10)\n})\n\nseason_names &lt;- names(top10_list)\nfig &lt;- plot_ly()\n\nfor (i in seq_along(top10_list)) {\n  season_data &lt;- top10_list[[i]]\n  fig &lt;- add_trace(\n    fig,\n    data = season_data,\n    x = ~W,\n    y = ~team,\n    type = \"bar\",\n    orientation = \"h\",\n    marker = list(\n      color = ~x3p_percent,\n      colorscale = list(c(0, \"lightblue\"), c(1, \"darkblue\")),\n      colorbar = list(title = \"3P%\")\n    ),\n    text = ~paste0(\n      \"Team: \", team, \"&lt;br&gt;Wins: \", W, \n      \"&lt;br&gt;3PA: \", x3pa, \"&lt;br&gt;3P%: \", round(x3p_percent * 100, 1), \"%\"\n    ),\n    hoverinfo = \"text\",\n    visible = ifelse(i == 1, TRUE, FALSE)\n  )\n}\n\nbuttons &lt;- lapply(seq_along(season_names), function(i) {\n  visible &lt;- rep(FALSE, length(season_names))\n  visible[i] &lt;- TRUE\n  team_order &lt;- rev(top10_list[[i]]$team)\n  list(\n    method = \"update\",\n    args = list(\n      list(visible = visible),\n      list(yaxis = list(\n        title = \"\",\n        categoryorder = \"array\",\n        categoryarray = team_order\n      ))\n    ),\n    label = season_names[i]\n  )\n})\n\nfig &lt;- fig |&gt;\n  layout(\n    title = \"Top 10 Teams: Wins and 3-Point Shooting (2014-2019)\",\n    xaxis = list(title = \"Wins\"),\n    yaxis = list(\n      title = \"\",\n      categoryorder = \"array\",\n      categoryarray = rev(top10_list[[1]]$team)\n    ),\n    updatemenus = list(\n      list(\n        active = 0,\n        buttons = buttons,\n        x = -0.5,\n        xanchor = \"left\",\n        y = 1.2,\n        yanchor = \"top\"\n      )\n    ),\n    showlegend = FALSE\n  )\n\nfig\nOver the years, we can see a clear pattern: the teams that won the most games are also the ones taking the most three-point shots. But why did this trend emerge? As players became more skilled, elite shooters were able to increase their three-point volume while maintaining high efficiency. This shift forced teams to recognize the true value of the three-pointer from a strategic standpoint.\nA player hitting 40% from three generates 1.2 points per shot, while a player shooting 50% on two-pointers produces only 1.0 point per shot. As long range accuracy continued to improve, the advantage of the three-point shot became undeniable. Teams realized that by incorporating more threes into their offensive strategy, they could maximize scoring potential without sacrificing efficiency. This evolution not only changed individual player behavior but also reshaped overall team strategies, making the three-point shot a central element of the modern game.",

    "text": "3.2 The Ripple Effect: How the Three Reshaped the Court\nWe have seen that the most successful teams take more three-point shots. To explain the underlying mechanics behind the surge in three-point volume we are going to look at how teams created the opportunities to take so many shots. The answer lies in pace (possessions per game).\n\n\nCode\nggplot(league_stats, aes(x = season_start, y = pace)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#1ABC9C\", size = 1.3) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#1ABC9C\", size = 2.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Pace of Play Accelerates the 3-Point Revolution\",\n    subtitle = \"League-wide pace: possessions per 48 minutes (1980–2025)\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Pace (Possessions per 48)\",\n    caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2014, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray50\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2015, y = max(league_stats$pace) - 1,\n           label = \"Start of rapid pace rise\", color = \"gray30\", hjust = 0) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray40\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing three-point attempts didn’t just require better shooters. It required a faster, more dynamic style of play. Teams had to generate more possessions to fully capitalize on the scoring advantage of the three-pointer. This shift in tempo and strategy gave rise to what is now known as the “Pace and Space” era, where speed, spacing, and efficient long-range shooting became the cornerstone of winning basketball.\nNow that the game is faster, who is taking the shots? It used to be only guards. Now, to get that volume, big men have to shoot too.\n\n\nCode\nget_positional_stats &lt;- function(year) {\n  Sys.sleep(2) \n  url &lt;- paste0(\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_\", year, \"_per_game.html\")\n  \n  tryCatch({\n    page &lt;- read_html(url)\n    df &lt;- page |&gt;\n      html_element(\"table#per_game_stats\") |&gt;\n      html_table() |&gt;\n      clean_names() |&gt;\n      filter(player != \"Player\") |&gt;\n      mutate(\n        season = year,\n        x3pa = as.numeric(x3pa),\n        pos_clean = str_remove(pos, \"-.*\") \n      ) |&gt;\n      select(season, player, pos_clean, x3pa)\n    \n    df |&gt;\n      group_by(season, pos_clean) |&gt;\n      summarize(avg_3pa = mean(x3pa, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n      \n  }, error = function(e) {\n    message(paste(\"Error for year\", year))\n    return(NULL)\n  })\n}\n\ntarget_years &lt;- c(1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015:2024)\nheatmap_data &lt;- map_dfr(target_years, get_positional_stats)\n\nplot_data &lt;- heatmap_data |&gt;\n  filter(pos_clean %in% c(\"PG\", \"SG\", \"SF\", \"PF\", \"C\"))\n\nplot_data$pos_clean &lt;- factor(plot_data$pos_clean, \n                              levels = c(\"C\", \"PF\", \"SF\", \"SG\", \"PG\"))\n\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = as.factor(season), y = pos_clean, fill = avg_3pa)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", size = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(\n    low = \"#313695\",\n    mid = \"#FFFFBF\",\n    high = \"#A50026\",\n    midpoint = 2.5,\n    name = \"Avg 3PA\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Blurring the Lines\",\n    subtitle = \"Average 3-Point Attempts by Position (1990-2024)\",\n    caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference | Note: Positions are simplified (e.g. PF-C -&gt; PF)\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, color = \"gray40\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nleague_avgs &lt;- league_avgs |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    ft_pct = as.numeric(ft_percent) * 100  \n  )\n\nggplot(league_avgs,\n       aes(x = start_year, y = ft_pct)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#9B59B6\", size = 1.4) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#9B59B6\", size = 2.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linetype = \"dashed\", \n              color = \"#34495E\", size = 0.8) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1980, max(league_avgs$start_year), 5)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(70, 80, 1), limits = c(70, 80)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The Skill Dividend\",\n    subtitle = \"League average free throw percentage (1979–2025)\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Free Throw Percentage (%)\",\n    caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference\"\n  ) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1990, y = 74, \n           label = \"90s/00s Era\\n~73-75%\", \n           size = 3.5, color = \"#9B59B6\", fontface = \"italic\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2020, y = 78.5, \n           label = \"Modern Era\\n~78-79%\", \n           size = 3.5, color = \"#9B59B6\", fontface = \"italic\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray40\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing the pace wasn’t enough; teams needed a fundamental upgrade in skill across the roster. As evidenced by the league wide rise in Free Throw percentage, the average modern player is simply a more capable shooter than their predecessors. This “skill dividend” allowed the revolution to spread to the frontcourt. Initially a weapon reserved for guards, the three point shot was adopted by Power Forwards and eventually Centers.\nThe heatmap above visualizes a core strategic insight of the modern era: Spacing. When five players, including the Center, can shoot, the floor spreads completely. This forces the defense to guard the perimeter.

As three-point shooting became more prevalent, the floor naturally spread, reducing the value of midrange shots while opening up driving lanes which we can see from the stacked area chart. With big men stepping out to the perimeter, the court became much more spacious, creating opportunities for players to attack the rim. This marked one of the most significant strategic shifts in NBA history. Teams recognized that a long two-pointer, historically making around 38 to 40 percent of the time, was mathematically inferior to a three-pointer. Consequently, the midrange jumper gradually disappeared from the modern game. Interestingly, the trend in the chart above shows that midrange feild goals declined. Layups and dunks actually increased highlighting the shift toward high-efficiency scoring opportunities as NBA players can very easily make open shots near the rim.\nWith these playstyles making scoring more efficient, let’s examine how they impacted overall scoring trends.\n\n\nCode\nscoring_output &lt;- league_avgs |&gt;\n  inner_join(\n    league_stats |&gt; select(season_start, pace),\n    by = c(\"start_year\" = \"season_start\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    pts_num = as.numeric(pts),\n    fga_num = as.numeric(fga),\n    ppg = pts_num\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(start_year, ppg, fga_num) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(ppg), !is.na(fga_num))\n\n# Plot: PPG over time\nggplot(scoring_output,\n       aes(x = start_year, y = ppg)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#E74C3C\", size = 1.5) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#E74C3C\", size = 2.5, alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Year\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(100, 120, 2.5)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The Efficiency Dividend\",\n    subtitle = \"Points per game increased\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Points Per Game\",\n    caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0.5, color = \"gray40\"),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this shift in strategy worth it? The results are clear. By optimizing shot selection and developing greater skill, teams have achieved unprecedented scoring levels. The league has moved from the defensive struggles of the early 2000s to a modern era defined by efficiency and precision. The three-point revolution did not just reshape the spacing on the court; it transformed NBA offense into a finely tuned, high-scoring machine.",

    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe three-point revolution in the NBA represents one of modern sports’ most dramatic transformations, yet it remains largely unexplored quantitatively. We chose this topic to answer a simple question: How has basketball fundamentally changed? For unfamiliar readers, the NBA is the world’s premier professional basketball league where, historically, games centered on post players (the tallest/biggest people on the court) and half-court offense. Today, they center on perimeter shooting and pace. The three-point line was introduced in 1979 but was largerly not utilized until it became mathematically superior to mid-range shooting. Our central questions are: When did teams collectively adopt this strategy? Did all positions transform equally? And did the revolution actually make basketball better? Through statistical analysis of 45 years of NBA data (1979-2024), we provide quantifiable evidence of how basketball’s most fundamental strategic shift unfolded.",

    "text": "The three-point revolution has fundamentally reshaped the NBA, evolving it from a midrange-heavy game into a high-efficiency system defined by “Pace and Space.” Our analysis confirms that this shift was driven not just by an increase in volume, but by a concurrent rise in skill; elite shooters maintained efficiency despite higher usage, and the “skill dividend” expanded to frontcourt players, effectively eliminating the traditional non-shooting center. This evolution has optimized scoring output, as teams mathematically prioritized three-pointers and rim attempts over inefficient long twos. Our data collection process presented significant challenges. Basketball Reference’s data protection mechanisms prevented us from scraping our primary target tables, forcing us to utilize alternative tables that contained the necessary metrics. Additionally, merging these disparate sources required data cleaning to standardize inconsistent column names and formats across different seasons. Future research could expand on this foundation by analyzing the specific defensive schemes evolved to counter this spacing or by isolating individual player archetypes to see which specific roles have gained or lost the most value in this new era.",
